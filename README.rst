Escape
======

A basic adventure game by Trevor Bramwell.

Overview
--------

Escape is a classic text based adventure game set aboard the spaceship
of an unknown enemy.

You wake up in the brige with chaos all around you as the ship is under
attack. You must find the courage to face all the dangers that will come
before you, as you try to escape the ship, and find your way to freedom.

Controls
--------

As with most text based adventure games, there are a few simple
keywords, or controls that will help you navigate the game world.

* l(ook) - Look around and examine the room you're in.
* i(nventory) - List items in your inventory.
* o(pen) - Open doors, chests, and other items.
* c(lose) - Close all of the above.
* t(alk) - Talk to an Non-playable Character (NPC) in the game world.

Movement
--------

Movement throughout the gameworld is handled by directional keywords.
Each room lists all possible exits that a play may take.

* n(orth)
* s(outh)
* e(ast)
* w(est)
* u(p)
* d(own)

Any combination of 'nw', 'ne', 'se', 'sw', is also valid.
